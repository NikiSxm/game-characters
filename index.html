            <h2>Kirby</h2>
            <p>
                Kirby's signature skill is his ability to inhale objects or creatures and
                spit them out as projectiles, as well as the ability to suck in air to float over obstacles.
                His Copy Ability grants him the power to adopt the abilities of the creatures he inhales,
                while also wearing various costumes or transforming his shape.

                Sonic the Hedgehog is the protagonist of Sega's video game franchise Sonic the Hedgehog. 
                Sonic is an anthropomorphic blue hedgehog who can run at supersonic speeds and curl into a 
                ball to attack enemies. He races through levels, collecting power-up rings and avoiding obstacles, 
                as he seeks to defeat the mad scientist Doctor Eggman.
